## Introduction
The Smart Energy Consumption Tracker is a web application that aims to assist users, especially small-scale companies manage their energy usage efficiently. It is an intelligent tool to track their electricity usage, predict future electricity bills, and offer personalized recommendations to reduce costs. By enabling users to input appliance data and usage patterns, the system calculates energy consumption, predicts electricity bills using a machine learning model, and offers actionable insights to optimize energy use to cut companies' costs.


## Project Overview
Describe the project in detail. Include:

This project addresses the growing need for efficient energy management in commercial settings. It leverages modern web and machine learning technologies to provide users with detailed insights into their energy consumption. The application is aimed at small-scale company owners, building managers, and environmentally conscious individuals who want to monitor and reduce their energy expenses. By integrating historical electricity rate data and standard consumption values, the project not only predicts future bills but also offers personalized energy-saving tips, that can be used to significantly save budget and reduce environmental footprint.

## Objectives
State the main objectives of the capstone project, such as:
- Develop a solution for [problem].
- Implement features to [goal].
- Test and validate [key aspect].

## Features
- Smart Energy Consumption Calculator: Users input details about their appliances (quantity and estimated duration of usage) to calculate the total energy consumption based on standard consumption values.
- Bill Prediction with LSTM Model: The system retrieves the calculated energy consumption data and processes it through an (LSTM/Regression) machine learning model trained on historical electricity rate data, providing users with an estimated electricity bill.
- Energy-Saving Recommendations: Based on the consumption breakdown, the system generates personalized optimization tipsâ€”such as reducing aircon usage, and switching to LED lighting help users reduce their overall energy consumption.

## Technologies Used
Mention the tools, frameworks, and technologies used in the project:
- Programming Languages: [Python, JavaScript]
- Frameworks/Libraries: [eReact, Django]
- Databases: [Firebase Realtime Database]
- Other Tools: [Git]
